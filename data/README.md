# Wab Tests

This directory contains a few small test programs to test the Wab language.
To use these, you will need a parser which doesn't actually get created until
Project 8!   So, you probably won't find these tests to be too useful until
later.

Also, the Wab language itself is pretty limited.  I mean, it doesn't even have
subtraction!  That will get resolved in the next stage of the project.
